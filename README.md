# News App
<h2>Project Overview:</h2>

The final project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making your own app that connects to the Internet to provide news articles on a topic of your choice.

The goal is to create a News feed app which gives a user regularly-updated news from the internet related to a particular topic, person, or location. The presentation of the information as well as the topic is up to you.

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>App contains a main screen which displays multiple news stories</b></li>
<br>
<li><b>Each list item on the main screen displays relevant text and information about the story.
<br>Required fields include the title of the article and the name of the section that it belongs to.
<br>Optional fields (if available) : author name , date published</li></b>
<br>
<li><b>The code adheres to all of the following best practices:</b>
  <ul><li>Text sizes are defined in sp</li>
  <li>Lengths are defined in dp</li>
  <li>Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other.</li>
</ul></li>
<br>
<li><b>Stories shown on the main screen update properly whenever new news data is fetched from the API.</li></b>
<br>
<li><b>The code runs without errors.</li></b>
<br>
<li><b>Clicking on a story opens the story in the user’s browser.</li></b>
<br>
<li><b>App queries the content.guardianapis.com api to fetch news stories related to the topic chosen by the student, using either the ‘test’ api key or the student’s key.</li></b>
<br>
<li><b>Networking operations are done using a Loader rather than an AsyncTask.</li></b>
<br>
<li><b>The intent of this project is to give you practice writing raw Java code using the necessary classes provided by the Android framework; therefore, the use of external libraries for the core functionality will not be permitted to complete this project.</li></b>
<br>
<li><b>Code is easily readable such that a fellow programmer can understand the purpose of the app.</li></b>
<br>
<li><b>All variables, methods, and resource IDs are descriptively named such that another developer reading the code can easily understand their function.</li></b>
<br>
<li><b>The code is properly formatted i.e. there are no unnecessary blank lines; there are no unused variables or methods; there is no commented out code.
<br>The code also has proper indentation when defining variables and methods.</li></b>
</ul><br>
